# odin-recipies

#### Description
This project is the first project of Odin Project, an Open Source Course designed to teach me front end development. 

It includes some of my favorite recipes that I have found on allrecipes.com, The butter chicken one is great.

I've successfully implemented a simple HTML website with multiple pages and basic navigation.

With this project I have been able to use what I've learned in using Git, writing pure HTML code including lists, links, images, and more.
